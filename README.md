# WLMatrix
A translation layer between MSNP18 and the Matrix Protocol.

## How it will work
WLMatrix is a TCP/Soap server and a Matrix client.
It translates the commands & requests from Windows Live Messenger to the Matrix Protocol.

## Current state
ðŸŸ¢ Patching WLM to allow it to connect to localhost without using ssl.

ðŸŸ¢ Authentication

The typical @name:homeserver syntax of matrix cannot work with wlm. This syntax is used instead : {name@homeserver-port} when the port is ommited, 443 will be default.

ðŸŸ  Fetch contact lists (joined rooms & invites) (MSN: /AbServices.asmx/FindMembership & getContactsPaged <-> Matrix: sync endpoint)

ðŸ”´ Everything else
	

## Dependecies

## Special Thanks
Thanks a lot to the Escargot team for all their hard work & compilation of great resources.

Thanks to the people from 2005 that had msnp packets in their .pcap without noticing it
