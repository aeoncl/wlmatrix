# WLMatrix
A translation layer between MSNP18 and the Matrix Protocol
making WLM 2009 a Matrix client while keeping all of it's functionality.

## How it will work
WLMatrix is a TCP/Soap server and a Matrix client that runs in the background when WLM starts.
It translates the commands & requests from MSNP to the Matrix Protocol.

## Current state
ðŸŸ¢ Client patch to connect to WLMatrix (info in the wiki)

ðŸŸ¢ Authentication (from MSN -> Matrix) The typical @name:homeserver syntax of matrix cannot work with wlm. This syntax is used instead : {name@homeserver-port} when the port is ommited, 443 will be default.

ðŸŸ  Fetch contact lists (joined rooms & invites) (MSN: /AbServices.asmx/FindMembership & getContactsPaged <-> Matrix: sync endpoint)

ðŸ”´ Everything else
